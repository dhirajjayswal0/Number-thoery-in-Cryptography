# Number-thoery-in-Cryptography

Abstract:

Number theory is a branch of pure mathematics that is devoted to the study of the integers, integer-valued functions as well as the properties of mathematical objects made out of integers. Cryptography is the practice and study of techniques used for constructing and analyzing protocols that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages. Here number theory is used in the process of encryption and decryption to make the channel more secure.


Introduction:

This research paper is dedicated to exploring the use of number theory in the process of cryptography. In this modern world of technologies, we have most of our communication over the internet. Be it our day-to-day calls via apps like Messenger and WhatsApp or our messages via platforms like Instagram, Facebook, or Twitter. Not only that but everything we browse over the internet such as mail or a shopping website uses some kind of data. These data may include details ranging from bank account details, home address to your communication. The use of the internet would not be preferable if these data could be accessed and read by anyone and everyone over the internet. Thus comes the concept of Cryptography. WhatsApp and other similar platforms use end-to-end encryption over their channel which makes sure that even if someone gets access to your data unless they have the decryption key they won't be able to read it as it will be an encrypted format.
